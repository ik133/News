            <p>The economy of Pakistan is classified as a developing economy. It is the 23rd-largest in terms of GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP). In 2021, the country had a population of 227 million people. As of FY22, the nominal GDP of Pakistan stands at US$376 billion with a nominal GDP per capita of US$1,658 (177th); its GDP based on PPP stands at US$1.512 trillion with a GDP (PPP) per capita of US$6,662 (168th).[4]

                In the formative decades of Pakistan, the economy was largely based on private industries. Nationalisation of significant portion of the sector including financial services, manufacturing and transportation had begun in the early 1970s. With the beginning of Zia-ul Haq's regime in the 1980s, a more "Islamic" economy was adopted which outlawed economic practices forbidden in Sharīʿah and mandated traditional religious practices instead. Although, the economy began to privatise in the 1990s.
                
                The growth poles of Pakistan's economy are situated along the Indus River;[33][34] the diversified economies of Karachi and major urban centres in Punjab, co-existing with lesser developed areas in other parts of the country.[33] Pakistan was classified as a semi-industrial economy for first time in late 1990s albeit an underdeveloped country[35] with heavy dependence on agriculture, textile industry being dependent on cotton production.[36][33][37] Primary export commodities include textiles, leather goods, sports equipment, chemicals, and carpets/rugs.[38][39]
                
                Pakistan is currently undergoing a process of economic liberalization, including the privatization of all government corporations, which is aimed at attracting foreign investment and decreasing budget deficits.[40] However, the country continues to face the challenges of rapidly growing population, high illiteracy, corruption, political instability, a hostile neighborhood and heavy foreign debt.
                
                Falling low on budgets for paying interest on its debt, Pakistan has been facing an economic crisis since 2022. Amid adverse effects of ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, Pakistan has been facing shortage in supply and high inflation in prices of food, oil, gas and electricity. The crisis has led to sharp deappreciation of Pakistani ruppee and downgrading of country's credit ratings by various agencies which has further increased the possibility of default.

                Main article: Economic history of Pakistan
                1940s-50s
                At Pakistan's inception in 1947, Pakistan was an agrarian economy. Agriculture contributed 53% GDP and 53.2% in 1949-50, employing 65% of Pakistani labour force, contributing to 99.2% of country's exports and earning 90% of foreign exchanges. Pakistan had a total population of 30 millions of which 6 millions lived in cities. It had a literacy rate of 10% and a poverty ratio of 55-60%. Both West and East Pakistan had immense amounts of minerals and natural resources, including natural gas, crude coil, coal, limestone and marble.[41]
                
                In 1950, Pakistan registered national and foreign savings rates of 2% each, and an investment rate of 4%. The manufacturing contributed 7.8% of GDP while other sectors contributed 39% of that. Trade balance in payments was 66 million ruppees deficit in 1949-50 which led Pakistan to adopt imports substituting industrialisation.
