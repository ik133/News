        The Higher Education Commission (HEC) Wednesday directed higher education institutions (HEIs) to "distance
        themselves" from activities "incompatible with the country's identity and societal values."

        The commission's decision came a few days after students at theQuaid-i-Azam University (QAU) in Islamabad
        celebrated Holi — a Hindu religious festival celebrated during spring — stirring controversy across social
        media, with some praising the act and others directing criticism towards the organisers.

        The Holi celebrations took place earlier this month, with a huge number of students partaking in the event. A
        Twitter account, sharing updates of the Quaid-i-Azam University, posted a video where students were seen
        celebrating the event.


        In light of the much-talked-about celebrations, the commission has decided to restrict such events in order to
        preserve the nation's ideology stating that HEIs have an ultimate responsibility to polish and nurture the
        exuberance of youth into learned, mature, and responsible citizens.

        "Foregoing in view, it is advised that the HEIs may prudently distance themselves from all such activities
        obviously incompatible with the country's identity and societal values, white ensuring that they rigorously
        engage their students and facutty in academic pursuits, intellectual debates, and cognitive learning besides
        identifying, creating, and fostering avenues for extra-curricular activities and rational discourse," a
        notification released by HEC read.
        [9:31 pm, 22/06/2023] 03340249617: In its notification, the commission wrote: "Unfortunately, it is sad to
        witness activities that portray a complete disconnect from our sociocultural values and an erosion of the
        country’s Islamic identity."

        The commission added that one such "widely reported" and "publicised" instance involving the fervour exhibited
        in celebrating Holi from the platform of a university has "caused concern and has disadvantageously affected the
        country’s image."

        "While there is no denying the fact that cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity leads towards an inclusive
        and tolerant society, that profoundly respects all faiths, and creeds; albeit it needs to be done so in a
        measured manner without going overboard," it mentioned.

        HEC reminded higher education institutions to "apprise students about being aware of the self-serving vested
        interests who use them for their own ends far from the altruistic critical thinking paradigm.</p>
