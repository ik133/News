        <p>The article looked at 200 people aged between 50 and 70 forming part of the DIABIMCAP cohort and recruited by
            the IDIBAPS Primary healthcare transversal research group, led by Antoni Sisó Almirall. The volunteers
            taking part in the study were analysed with regard to two parameters: the concentration of carotenes in the
            blood and, by means of ultrasound imaging, the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery.

            "The study concludes that the greater the concentration of carotenes in the blood, the lesser the
            atherosclerotic burden, particularly in women. […] So, we can confirm that a diet rich in fruit and
            vegetables and thus in carotenes lowers the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases," said Chiva
            Blanch. adjusted analysis, the incidence of HO was reduced by half in the TXA group, with an odds ratio of
            0.49.

            Anti-inflammatory effects of TXA may help to prevent HO
            The incidence of clinically important HO, based on the presence of functional limitations, was 2.07% in
            patients who received TXA compared with 5.80% in those who did not. For this outcome, risk was reduced by
            two-thirds in the TXA group, with an odds ratio of 0.34. Tranexamic acid was associated with a lower risk of
            HO across patient subgroups with differing characteristics.

            This study provides the first published evidence that using TXA during elbow trauma surgery can help lower
            the risk of postoperative HO. Previous reports have found that reducing inflammation can reduce HO formation
             "indicating that the inflammatory response acts as a necessary starting factor for HO development," the
            researchers write. The authors discuss recent evidence suggesting the potential anti-inflammatory properties
            of TXA.

            Dr. Fan and coauthors note the limitations of their retrospective analysis and highlight the need for larger
            studies, including those to assess laboratory markers of inflammation. In the meantime, the researchers
            conclude, "TXA prophylaxis may be an appropriate method for the prevention of HO following surgery for the
            treatment of elbow trauma."</p>
